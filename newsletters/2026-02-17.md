Hey there 👋

Quick update on what's been happening at Semos Labs this week.

## New on the blog

**[How Glyph Works Under the Hood](https://semos.sh/blog/how-glyph-works)** — A deep dive into Glyph's render pipeline. How a React reconciler, Yoga flexbox, a double-buffered framebuffer, and character-level diffing come together to draw UIs in your terminal.

If you've ever wondered how React can render to something that isn't a browser — this one's for you.

## Glyph

- Improved character-level diffing for even faster redraws
- Better contrast detection for text on colored backgrounds
- New `useFocusable` hook for building custom interactive components

## Aion

- Google Calendar sync improvements
- Better timezone handling for recurring events

## Epist

- Thread view performance improvements
- Better attachment handling
