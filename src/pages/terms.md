## Overview

These terms govern your use of the Semos AI service ("Service"), operated by Semos Labs ("we", "us"). By creating an account or using the Service, you agree to these terms.

Semos AI provides AI-powered terminal assistance — error analysis, command generation, output summarization, and selection explanation — delivered through our API and integrated into terminal applications.

## Accounts

- You must provide a valid email address to create an account
- You are responsible for all activity under your account
- You may not share your credentials or access tokens with others
- We may suspend or terminate accounts that violate these terms

## Service Plans and Billing

- **Free plan** — available to all users with limited monthly requests and token usage
- **Pro plan** — higher limits and access to more capable models, billed monthly via Paddle
- Plan limits (requests, tokens, rate limits) are enforced server-side
- You can upgrade, downgrade, or cancel your subscription at any time through the dashboard
- Cancellation takes effect at the end of the current billing period
- We do not provide refunds for partial billing periods

## Acceptable Use

You agree not to:

- Use the Service for any unlawful purpose
- Attempt to circumvent rate limits, quotas, or access controls
- Reverse engineer, probe, or test the vulnerability of the Service
- Resell or redistribute access to the Service without permission
- Submit content that is harmful, abusive, or violates the rights of others
- Use automated tools to access the Service beyond normal CLI usage

## Data and Privacy

- We store your email address and account metadata for authentication and billing
- Terminal context (commands, output) sent to the API is forwarded to LLM providers for processing and is not stored by us after the request completes
- Usage metrics (request counts, token usage) are tracked for quota enforcement
- We do not sell your data to third parties
- See individual product privacy policies for product-specific details: [Aion](/aion/privacy), [Epist](/epist/privacy)

## Availability and Liability

- The Service is provided "as is" without warranties of any kind
- We do not guarantee uninterrupted or error-free operation
- AI-generated responses may be inaccurate — you are responsible for reviewing and validating any suggestions before acting on them
- We are not liable for any damages resulting from your use of the Service, including but not limited to data loss, system damage, or incorrect commands
- Our total liability is limited to the amount you paid for the Service in the 12 months preceding the claim

## Changes

We may update these terms from time to time. Continued use of the Service after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated terms. We will make reasonable efforts to notify you of significant changes via email or the dashboard.

## Termination

We may suspend or terminate your access to the Service at any time, with or without cause. You may delete your account at any time by contacting us.
