## TL;DR

All payments for Attyx Pro are non-refundable. You can cancel your subscription at any time, and it will remain active until the end of your current billing period.

## Subscription Plans

Attyx offers a **free plan** with limited monthly requests and a **Pro plan** with higher limits and access to more capable AI models, billed monthly.

## Payment Provider

All payments are processed by **Paddle**, our merchant of record. Paddle handles billing, invoicing, sales tax, and payment processing on our behalf. For billing inquiries or payment disputes, you can contact Paddle directly or reach out to us and we will assist. See [Paddle's Privacy Policy](https://www.paddle.com/legal/privacy) for details on how they handle your payment data.

## No Refunds

All payments are non-refundable. We do not provide refunds or credits for any reason, including:

- Partial or unused billing periods
- Unused time or quota
- Downgrading from Pro to Free
- Dissatisfaction with the Service

## Cancellation

You can cancel your Pro subscription at any time through the dashboard. When you cancel:

- Your subscription remains active until the end of the current billing period
- You will not be charged again after the current period ends
- No partial refund is issued for the remaining time in the current period

## Exceptions

In rare cases, we may issue refunds at our sole discretion — for example, if we charged you due to a billing error on our end. If you believe you were charged in error, contact us and we will review your case.
