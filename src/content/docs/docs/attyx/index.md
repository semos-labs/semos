Attyx is a fast, GPU-accelerated terminal environment written in **Zig**. Persistent sessions, splits, tabs, popups, and GPU rendering — everything you need in a single binary.

## Install

### Homebrew (macOS)

```bash
brew install semos-labs/tap/attyx --cask
```

### Homebrew (Linux x86_64)

```bash
brew install semos-labs/tap/attyx
```

On Linux, Attyx installs as a desktop application. It should appear in your app launcher automatically. If it doesn't, log out and back in to refresh the desktop entry cache.

### Build from source

Requires **Zig 0.15.2+**.

```bash
zig build run
```

## Configuration

Attyx is configured via `~/.config/attyx/attyx.toml`. See the [configuration docs](/docs/attyx/configuration/) for all options, or check the included [`attyx.toml.example`](https://github.com/semos-labs/attyx/blob/main/config/attyx.toml.example) for a quick-start template.

## Features

- **Deterministic VT-compatible engine** — predictable, reproducible terminal behavior
- **GPU-accelerated rendering** — Metal on macOS, OpenGL on Linux
- **Status bar** — configurable widgets for cwd, git branch, time, and custom scripts
- **Sessions** — tmux-style workspace management with a background daemon
- **Visual mode** — Vim-inspired keyboard-driven text selection with character, line, and block modes
- **Command palette** — searchable list of all actions with `Cmd+Shift+P` / `Ctrl+Shift+P`
- **Native macOS tabs** — system window tabs alongside the built-in overlay tab bar
- **Full SGR support** — 16, 256, and 24-bit true color
- **Scrollback buffer** — configurable size with efficient memory usage
- **Mouse support** — X10 and SGR mouse encoding, text selection
- **In-terminal search** — incremental search with smart-case matching
- **TOML + CLI configuration** — human-readable config with hot reload
- **Cross-platform** — macOS and Linux
- **Unicode support** — proper wide-character handling
- **Alternate screen buffer** — full support for TUI applications
- **Hyperlinks** — OSC 8 clickable URLs in terminal output
- **IME support** — input method editor for CJK and other languages
- **Bracketed paste mode** — safe pasting with shell awareness
- **Kitty graphics protocol** — display images and rich visual content in the terminal
- **Kitty keyboard protocol** — unambiguous key reporting with modifier keys, key release events, and full disambiguation
- **Background transparency + blur** — opacity control with blur effects
- **Reflow on resize** — preserves text wrapping when terminal size changes
- **Scroll regions** — DECSTBM top/bottom margins for scrolling areas
- **Synchronized output** — deferred rendering for smooth TUI updates
- **Session logging** — bounded ring buffer of session events
- **Cursor trail** — optional cursor trail effect
