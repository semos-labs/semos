title: Introduction
description: Welcome to Semos — a family of terminal apps and tools.
---

Semos Labs builds modern terminal applications and libraries. We believe the command line is not a limitation — it's a canvas.

## The Ecosystem

Our ecosystem includes a React-based terminal renderer, TUI apps built on it, and a standalone terminal emulator:

| Project | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Glyph** | React renderer for terminal UIs |
| **Aion** | Calendar TUI client (Google Calendar & CalDAV) |
| **Epist** | Email TUI client (Gmail & IMAP/SMTP) |
| **Attyx** | Deterministic terminal emulator (alpha) |

## Philosophy

- **Terminal-first.** We live in the terminal. Our tools are built for developers who think in keystrokes, not clicks.
- **React-powered.** Declarative components meet terminal rendering. Build TUIs the same way you build web apps.
- **One ecosystem.** Glyph powers everything. Aion, Epist, and your next app — all share the same foundation.

## Getting Started

Pick a product to dive in:

- [Glyph](/docs/glyph/) — if you want to build your own TUI apps
- [Aion](/docs/aion/) — if you want your calendar in the terminal (Google Calendar & CalDAV)
- [Epist](/docs/epist/) — if you want email in the terminal (Gmail & IMAP/SMTP)
- [Attyx](/docs/attyx/) — a deterministic terminal emulator (alpha)
