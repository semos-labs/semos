title: Introduction
description: Welcome to Semos — a family of terminal apps and tools.
---

Semos Labs builds modern terminal applications and libraries. We believe the command line is not a limitation — it's a canvas.

## The Ecosystem

Everything in Semos is built around **Glyph** — a React-based terminal renderer. Our apps are built on top of it:

| Project | What it does |
|---------|-------------|
| **Glyph** | React renderer for terminal UIs |
| **Aion** | Google Calendar TUI client |
| **Epist** | Gmail TUI client |

## Philosophy

- **Terminal-first.** We live in the terminal. Our tools are built for developers who think in keystrokes, not clicks.
- **React-powered.** Declarative components meet terminal rendering. Build TUIs the same way you build web apps.
- **One ecosystem.** Glyph powers everything. Aion, Epist, and your next app — all share the same foundation.

## Getting Started

Pick a product to dive in:

- [Glyph](/glyph/overview) — if you want to build your own TUI apps
- [Aion](/aion/overview) — if you want Google Calendar in your terminal
- [Epist](/epist/overview) — if you want Gmail in your terminal
