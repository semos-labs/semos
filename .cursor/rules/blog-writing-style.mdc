# Blog writing style

## Voice

- first person, casual, direct — like telling a story to a friend over drinks, but cleaned up for a blog
- short sentences. no fluff. get to the point
- opinionated — it's a personal blog, not docs. have strong takes
- technical but conversational, not academic
- occasional cursing is fine (shit, damn, hell) but don't overdo it — once or twice per post max
- use contractions (it's, don't, wasn't, couldn't)
- rhetorical questions are good. they keep the reader engaged
- show genuine excitement when something is cool. don't be robotic
- em dashes are great — use them freely
- avoid corporate speak, marketing language, or anything that sounds like a press release

## Structure

- blog posts live in `src/content/blog/` as `.md` or `.mdx` files
- filenames should be short and slug-friendly (e.g. `why-glyph.md`, not `why-i-built-a-react-renderer-for-the-terminal.md`)
- frontmatter schema: title, description, date, tags (optional), cover (optional), draft (optional)
- cover images go in `public/images/` and are referenced as `/images/filename.jpg`
- OG images are auto-generated at build time from the frontmatter — no need to create them manually
